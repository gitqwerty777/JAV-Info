## Database

All queries will be saved in `db-{language}.json`.

You can do dry run to check the rename progress and then execute without retrieving data again.

Failed requests will also be saved, so clean the database if something went wrong.

## Note

- Input **filename** should include bangou, or it cannot be renamed
- If there exist multiple files that have the same bangou, they will be renamed with the suffix serial number, ordered by original file name

## Future Work

- Execute
  - fill video metadata in file
  - options for new folder
- FileName
  - fit more types of bangou
- Database
  - use other method instead directly loading into memory
  - find other database which has chinese title
- UI
  - interface to search local database
